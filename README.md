# Overview

This project is a text-based Hangman game where the player guesses letters to uncover a secret word. It utilizes Rust's HashSet for managing guessed letters and rand for randomly selecting a word. This application highlights Rust's efficient handling of collections and its emphasis on safety and performance.

The purpose of this project is to improve my proficiency with Rust by applying its features to a complete, interactive program. Through this process, I gained experience in implementing loops, conditionals, and I/O operations in Rust as well as understanding its strict ownership model.
